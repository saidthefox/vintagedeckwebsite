  },
  "Narset, Parter of Veils": {
    "blurb": "Card advantage engine that draws cards and prevents opponents from drawing multiples. Forces discard against decks relying on card draw like Outcome combo."
  },
  "Tezzeret the Seeker": {
    "blurb": "I love this card. I got my foil Shards of Alara one in a friend's shop in Orlando, FL like a decade ago now. A lot of the times he is just a tutor, and you know what he is gunna go get. More rarely you'll get weird hands that give you win through +'ing with 4 artifacts on t1. Sometimes +'ing there can be into letting you cast Time Walk. Fun card–will always be well worth the slot to me."
  },
  "Tezzeret, Cruel Captain": {
    "blurb": "Early planeswalker that damages opponents per artifact and tutors artifacts. Flexible threat that demands answers or threatens damage."
  },
  "Blightsteel Colossus": {
    "blurb": "Infect threat that's uncounterable and unblockable once in play. Primary win condition when tutored via Tinker or other artifact tutors."
  },
  "Snapcaster Mage": {
    "blurb": "Flash creature that flashes back instants and sorceries, adding tempo and enabling instant-speed threats. Turns expensive tutors or countermagic into card advantage."
  },
  "Trinket Mage": {
    "blurb": "Tutors 0-drop artifacts like Lotus Petal or Vexing Bauble. Flexible creature that provides consistency and setup while being a decent body."
  },
  "Black Lotus": {
    "blurb": "The most powerful mana source in Magic. Provides three mana of any combination for one mana, enabling explosive early turns and combo setups."
  },
  "Lotus Petal": {
    "blurb": "Fast mana that sacrifices for one mana. Enables turn-one combo starts and flashing back spells with Snapcaster or cascading effects."
  },
  "Mana Crypt": {
    "blurb": "Zero-cost mana artifact that generates colorless mana each turn. Risk-reward of damage from flipping, but critical for early game acceleration."
  },
  "Mana Vault": {
    "blurb": "Accelerant that produces mana without tapping. Enables turn-two Tinker kills and untaps via Voltaic Key for infinite mana potential."
  },
  "Manifold Key": {
    "blurb": "Versatile artifact that untaps creatures or artifacts and draws cards. Enables Time Vault combos and utility land activation chains."

    "blurb": "Untaps artifacts for Time Vault and Mana Vault combos. Enables infinite mana generation or extra turns when assembled."
  },
  "Ancestral Recall": {
    "blurb": "Very good magic card. It rates high on both axis of blue draw spells: hand extension and card advantage. Hand extension being how good does the card extend the hand for the mana and time invested, and card advantage being getting more cards than you put in. Ancestral Recall is exemplar par excellence in blue draw for a reason. Basically think of it as for one mana you extend your hand by three cards rather than drawing cards."
  },
  "Brainstorm": {
    "blurb": "Very good magic card. It is the next best imitation of Ancestral Recall available. If we plot it on the same axis it gives you the same hand extension qualities of Ancestral Recall, as it sees three deep for one mana at instant speed, while less on the card advantage axis in terms of raw cards in hand. Brainstorm still enables the possibility you keep all three of the new cards you see though, and many times its \"downside\" is an upside for certain situations."
  },
  "Crop Rotation": {
    "blurb": "Basically this is a mini ritual for 2 mana a lot of times to go get Tolarian Academy. It very often will give you the one extra mana you needed to activate Key that turn rather than passing."
  },
  "Flusterstorm": {
    "blurb": "Cheap blue counterspell that cantrips and generates copies. Flexible protection against fast combo and blue players with multiple spells."
  },
  "Force of Negation": {

    "blurb": "The best counterspell in Magic. Pitched for free or cast for protection against any spell. Core of the blue control suite."
  },
  "Mental Misstep": {
    "blurb": "Negative cost that counters one-drop spells for free life loss. Strong early game protection against Thoughtseize, discard, and fast plays."
  },
  "Mystical Tutor": {
    "blurb": "Instant-speed library search for any blue card. Pairs with Brainstorm for instant tutoring or finds key answers at instant speed."
  },
  "Paradoxical Outcome": {
    "blurb": "Returns artifacts to hand for card advantage and mana generation. Can be a quick combo kill with enough cheap artifacts and mana sources."
  },
  "Pyroblast": {
    "blurb": "Very good magic card. Very close to not being in a flex slot, but sometimes the meta isn't there. It hit's so much that's relevant and can still do stack interaction, which is why it's so good. Abrupt Decay hits a lot of the same permanents you care about with it, and ignores them wanting to counter it, so can be a decent alternative–but missing out on the possibility of hitting their pertinent blue spell hurts."
  },
  "Vampiric Tutor": {
    "blurb": "Black tutoring at instant speed. Finds Tinker, discard effects, or Cabal Therapy setups instantly in response to development."
  },
  "Veil of Summer": {
    "blurb": "Very good magic card. Hexproof for yourself is quietly pretty relevant for those colors, and it's a good protection card to have. Starting off the turn with a Veil of Summer, even if you have nothing else to do, will tell you if your opponent has interaction in hand :)"
  },
  "Balance": {
    "blurb": "Symmetric board wipe that resets resources. Powerful in decks running few creatures and lands versus opposing creature decks."
  },
  "Cabal Therapy": {
    "blurb": "Very good magic card. It doesn't even matter if you hit. Just name the card you care about. If you hit that card, it's pure value. If you don't hit that card, it doesn't matter—unless it does of course—but it typically does not."
  },
  "Demonic Tutor": {
    "blurb": "Black tutoring for any card in the library. Finds Tinker, discard, or answers without restrictions, enabling any strategy."
  },
  "Gitaxian Probe": {
    "blurb": "Free card draw with phyrexian mana. Reveals opposing hand for information and triggers Snapcaster flashing back instants."
  },
  "Ponder": {
    "blurb": "Very good magic card. After Brainstorm it's the next closest analog to Ancestral, and on the hand extension aspect of things, it does that analog admirably. On the card advantage side of things though, it shines much less. You're typically going to want to see Ponder in lists looking to kill the opponent via looking at more cards and finding the right one, rather than lists that want more cards than their opponent period."
  },
  "Time Walk": {
    "blurb": "Extra turn for just three mana. Historically broken, enabling setup of lethal or advancing position against unprepared opponents."
  },
  "Timetwister": {

  },
  "Mana Confluence": {
    "blurb": "We will cast our spells! Pretend you have a gagillion life up until you have 2. Once you have two you can only tap your lands one more time before handing your opponent the win yourself."
  },
  "Tolarian Academy": {
    "blurb": "The namesake engine. Generates mana per instant or sorcery in graveyard, enabling infinite mana combos and card advantage."
  },
  "Urza's Saga": {
    "blurb": "Land that tutors artifacts and creates Constructs. Flexibly searches for key pieces while generating threats."
  },
  "Abrupt Decay": {
    "blurb": "Uncounterable removal for creatures and permanents up to three mana. Flexible answers to Planeswalkers and utility permanents."
  },
  "Archive Trap": {
    "blurb": "Mill trap that exiles opposing libraries from deck. Anti-synergy with self-mill strategies and breaks fetch-land strategies."
  },
  "Duress": {
    "blurb": "Discard effect against non-creature spells. Sideboard card for removing key combo pieces and sorceries from control decks."

    "blurb": "Instant removal that exiles creatures without affecting board state. Flexible answer to fast creature threats and evasive bodies."
  },
  "The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale": {
    "blurb": "Land that taxes creature activation. Sideboard land against token and creature-heavy strategies."
  },
  "Tormod's Crypt": {
    "blurb": "Graveyard hate artifact on a zero-drop body. Sideboard tech for decks relying on reanimation or self-mill strategies."
